# Automating Image Descriptions

Automating image descriptions is a challenging and a classic artificial intelligence problem. The idea is to develop an architecture, by leveraging existing models, that generates image descriptions using its predicted image features and objects. The architecture would obtain image features using Convolution Neural Networks (InceptionV3). The image descriptions could then be generated using LSTM (Long short-term Memory) Networks. The overall architecture follows an encoder-decoder pipeline.
